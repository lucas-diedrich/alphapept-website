The **alphapept** ecosystem is built on a commitment to openness, scientific excellence, interoperability, and community collaboration. These core principles guide every aspect of our work:

### Openness

We believe that transparency and accessibility are essential to scientific progress. All alphapept tools are fully open-source and freely available, enabling anyone to use, study, modify, and contribute to the software. Our development process is open by design, with community input shaping features, priorities, and long-term goals.

### Scientific Rigor

alphapept is dedicated to advancing computational proteomics through high-quality, peer-reviewed methods. Each tool in the ecosystem is built on per-reviewed algorithms, validated through careful benchmarking and aligned with current best practices in the field. Our goal is to empower researchers with reliable, cutting-edge solutions for the analysis of mass spectrometry data.

### Interoperability

We design our tools to work seamlessly within the broader scientific software ecosystem. By building on established standards and integrating with widely used platforms—such as Python-based analysis environments—we ensure that alphapept fits naturally into modern, modular workflows. This approach fosters flexibility, reproducibility, and scalability across diverse research contexts.

### Community Focus

alphapept is developed by researchers, for researchers. We prioritize usability, clear documentation, and responsive support to help scientists focus on discovery, not tooling. Community feedback is central to our roadmap, and we actively encourage collaboration, contributions, and shared learning. Our vision is to build not just software, but a vibrant, inclusive community around open proteomics.
