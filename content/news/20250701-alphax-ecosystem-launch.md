**Launching alpha-œÅ: Open and Modern Tools for Proteomics**

We are pleased to announce the release of **alpha-œÅ** (_pronounce: alpha-pro_) ecosystem, an open-source ecosystem of proteomics tools designed to accelerate mass spectrometry research and improve accessibility to advanced analysis methods.


**alpha-œÅ** bundles tools developed in the Mann Labs at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemsitry and the Insitute for Protein Research, Copenhagen into a unified ecosystem in which the individual tools can interact seamlessly with one another. **Taken together, it aims to provide a comprehensive suite of open source tools for the analysis of modern proteomics data**

The ecosystem brings together cutting-edge, peer-reviewed data structures, algorithms, and tools in a unified framework. All packages are freely available under permissive open-source licenses, making them accessible to all researchers. This comes along with comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and workflows are provided to ensure users can get started quickly. Development is guided by the needs of the proteomics community and shaped by ongoing feedback and collaboration. **We are open for contributions from the community to build upon and improve these tools**.

**Getting Started**

To begin using alpha-œÅ:

* Visit the [packages](/packages/) section to explore available software
* Follow our installation guides and quickstart tutorials
* Join discussions and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/alpha-œÅ-team)
* Read our [mission statement](/mission/) to learn more about our goals

**Looking Ahead**

We plan to further integrate alpha-œÅ with the broader scientific Python ecosystem, including tools like scverse. We are also expanding our outreach efforts, improving training resources, and supporting new developments in proteomics technologies, including emerging scan modes and instruments. We aim to provide long-term support for all available tools.

üéâ **Join us in creating an open ecosystem for the performant, scalable, and robust analysis of modern proteomics data**.
